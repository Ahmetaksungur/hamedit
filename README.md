A php file editor

HamEdit is a one page script that can handle the day to day file maintenance of a php server.  Filesystem handling and Text editing is all possible with a simple interface, and all calls are handled asynchronously for a smooth workflow.

THIS SCRIPT IS DISTRIBUTED ON AN AS IS BASIS.  I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DELETE YOUR BUTT.

Before you can do anything, you'll need to open the script in a text editor, and change the PASSWORD definition on line 13 of the minified script, or line 25 of the full script.
